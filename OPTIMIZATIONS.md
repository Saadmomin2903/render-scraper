# Optimizations for Render Deployment

The Facebook scraper has been optimized for deployment on Render's free tier. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Resource Optimizations

1. **Browser Configuration**

   - Reduced viewport size to 1366x768 (from 1920x1080)
   - Added flags to disable GPU acceleration
   - Limited JavaScript memory usage to 460MB
   - Disabled unnecessary Chrome features
   - Enabled single-process mode to reduce memory footprint

2. **Comment Loading Optimizations**

   - Reduced max attempts to load comments from 20 to 10
   - Simplified scrolling behavior
   - Reduced delays between actions
   - Removed complex mouse event simulation in favor of simpler clicks
   - Added comment count limit (50) to avoid resource exhaustion
   - Limited the number of scraped comments to 100 maximum

3. **Performance Improvements**

   - Simplified click handling
   - Removed multiple click fallback mechanisms
   - Optimized scrolling behavior
   - Disabled screenshot generation to save disk space
   - Added proper port handling for Render deployment

4. **Added Production Features**
   - Health check endpoint for monitoring
   - Dynamic port configuration
   - Resource utilization safeguards

## Docker Container Optimizations

1. **Base Image**

   - Used Python 3.9 slim for smaller image size

2. **Dependencies**

   - Installed only necessary system packages
   - Used `--no-cache-dir` to reduce image size

3. **Browser Setup**

   - Installed only Chromium (not all browsers)
   - Added necessary fonts and libraries

4. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Added render.yaml for Blueprint deployment
   - Configured for free tier

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**

   - Facebook credentials moved to environment variables
   - Set as non-synced in render.yaml for security

2. **Dockerignore**
   - Excluded unnecessary files from the build
   - Prevented sensitive information from being included in the image

## File Structure Optimizations

1. **Project Organization**
   - Added appropriate .gitignore
   - Added documentation
   - Created deployment configuration

## Usage Recommendations for Free Tier

1. **Rate Limiting**

   - Avoid frequent requests to prevent service throttling

2. **Startup Time**

   - First request after inactivity may take 1-2 minutes as the service wakes up

3. **Memory Usage**

   - Limited to scraping ~50-100 comments per post for stability

4. **Session Handling**
   - Be aware that Facebook may require CAPTCHA verification periodically
